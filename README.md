# Kanban Board

Here's a realization of CRUD-application named "Kanban Board".

Main technologies:

- Programming language: Typescript;
- Framework: React v19;
- State management library: Zustand;
- Pattern: FSD

Features:

- Drag-n-drop mechanism with @dnd-kit/core;
- Support of 11 languages;
- Validation of deadline date: if date is lower than current than deadline date is setting into current;

Need to add/upgrade/delete:

- Add more languages (Chinese, Dutch, Latvian, Portuguese and Swedish are in priority);
- Add filtration of boards (because there could a lot of boards);
- If you want me to add something here, check the social network links in my Github.
